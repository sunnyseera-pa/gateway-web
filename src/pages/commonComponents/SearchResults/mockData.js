SAIL is currently expediting all requests that feed directly into the response to the COVID-19 national emergency, and therefore requests from NHS or Government institutions, or organisations working alongside such care providers and policymakers to feed intelligence directly back into the national response, are being expedited with a ~48-hour governance turnaround for such applications once made. Please make enquiries using the link at the bottom of the page which will go the SAIL Databank team, or to Chris Orton at c.orton@swansea.ac.uk\n\nSAIL is welcoming requests from other organisations and for longer-term academic study on the dataset, but please note if this is not directly relevant to the emergency research being carried out which directly interfaces with national responding agencies, there may be an access delay whilst priority use cases are serviced.",

It includes babies in whom anomalies are diagnosed at any time from conception to the end of the first year of life. Data collection commenced on 1st January 1998 and includes any baby where pregnancy ended after this date.\n\nCARIS uses a multi-source data collection method using a wide range of sources within the NHS. This ranges from antenatal ultrasound, clinical letters, post-mortems and laboratory results. CARIS also accesses a number of databases including SHIRE (Medical Genetics database), PEDW, NCCHD, Paediatric Cardiology database. Medical records are accessed to confirm, validate and add further details to the information already collected.\n\nDue to the nature of this dataset linkage based on the babies is challenging. This is because many pregnancies (approximately 20% of the total) end in fetal loss or termination. However, linkage based on the mother can be performed.',

This list is referred to as the Shielded Patient List (SPL). \n\nThe “high risk” list was defined as a subset of a wider group of people who may be “at risk”. Specific advice applies to these groups, currently this advice is:\n • “At Risk” – large group normally at risk from the flu - should practice strict social distancing \n• “At high risk” – a smaller sub-group (circa 70k), defined by CMO – should practice complete social “shielding” NHS Digital have described the methodology that has been used to identify patients who meet the high risk criteria due to their inclusion in one or more of the disease groups. \n\nAs there are differences in some of the systems used across the devolved nations, nuanced differences in application and interpretation of CMO guidance, this document describes the Welsh methodology.\n\nhttps://nwis.nhs.wales/coronavirus/coronavirus-content/coronavirus-documents/covid-19-high-risk-shielded-patient-list-identification-methodology/',

Test results are electronically transferred from secondary care systems.\n\nThere are no standard rules for recording data within primary care clinical information systems. Therefore, each individual clinician can record information in their own way. The majority use Read Code Terminology, however, sometimes this is applied behind the scenes by the clinical system and sometimes local codes are used. Read codes are not as precise as ICD 10 or OPCS codes.\n\nCoding standards have been agreed on for conditions monitored by the QOF (Quality Outcomes Framework) returns. Since the implementation of QOF these conditions have been coded in a more consistent way.\n\nTime coverage varies between each practice.',

Includes spell and episode level data.\n\nThe data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).\n\nThe data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:\n\nCounts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;\nThere are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.\nWhen looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.\nCoding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.\n\nDue to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team. In turn the SAIL will seek advice from NWIS if required.',

            'The data is derived from linked primary, secondary and tertiary care electronic health records and participant survey responses. Data is de-identified at source (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) and ResearchOne) and linked using matching pseudonymous digests that are re-pseudonymised upon linkage by University of Leeds IT to produce irreversibly pseudonymous data that is processed into a research dataset. The data relates to the medical history of cancer patients prior to cancer, during their cancer diagnosis and treatment, and following their long-term outcomes, and the medical history of matched non-cancer patients that form a comparator cohort.\n\nThe data relates to 431,352 patients in the UK that LTHT have a ‘legitimate patient relationship’ with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient. Where available, data from ResearchOne provides primary care information for these patients. Where the patients were invited to participate in a patient reported outcomes measures survey (PROMS), this status is recorded. Where the patient returned a consented PROMS, the PROMS data will also be available once it has completed the extract, transform and load process. \n\nThe dataset is currently 5.7 GB and further ResearchOne and PROMS data is anticipated. The dataset is arranged as a relational database, with tables linking on the patient level by a pseudonymous digest. Each table is a comma separated values (CSV) file and relates to an event type, such as prescription cost, address history or diagnosis. All patients have an entry (row) in the demographics table; the number of times a patient has an entry in the other tables depends on how many events of that type were recorded for the patient. \n\nThe dataset is split into two files, each with similar table structure; the main dataset contains all patients and the PROMs dataset contains only those in the PROMs cohort (for whom additional PROMs data will be added). Each table has a re-pseudonymised digest field, “Digest2” and an indicator as to whether the patient has data from ResearchOne available, “TPP_Linked” (0 or 1). Additional fields per table are defined in Table 1. No fields contain sensitive information.\n\nContains patients in the UK that LTHT have a ‘legitimate patient relationship’ with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient.',

            'To identify and enrol participants for the 100,000 Genomes Project we have created NHS Genomic Medicine Centres (GMCs). Each centre includes several NHS Trusts and hospitals. GMCs recruit and consent patients. They then provide DNA samples and clinical information for analysis.\n\nIllumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient’s doctor.\n\nTo help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data – to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.\n\nFind out more\n\nTo learn more about how we work you can read the 100,000 Genomes Project protocol.
