      "description": "PURPOSE:The ketogenic diet is an alternative treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy. Most studies to date report dietary response in children. There are limited data evaluating the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in adults. This is a report of the long-term outcome in a largely adult population of patients treated with the ketogenic diet for epilepsy.\n\nMETHOD:Twenty-nine adult and adolescent patients (mean age 32 years, range 11-51) were initiated on the ketogenic diet and followed until diet discontinuation. Clinical response and adverse effects were noted during the duration of the diet.\n\nRESULTS:Fifty-two percent of patients had a significant reduction in seizure frequency on the ketogenic diet, including 45% with ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. Thirty-one percent had no improvement, seven percent were unable to successfully initiate the diet, and 10% had a >50% increase in seizure frequency. The diet was continued for a mean of 9 months (range 0.13-35 months), with five patients completing ≥23 months. There was a trend toward better response and better tolerability/longer duration in patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsy. The diet was generally well-tolerated, but undesired weight loss and constipation were the most frequent adverse effects.\n\nCONCLUSION:The ketogenic diet can be used safely in the adult and adolescent population, with a response rate similar to those seen in children. Patient with symptomatic generalized epilepsy may be particularly good candidates for this type of dietary treatment.",

The data is retrieved from SMART, but depending on the SMART server version, you may also be able edit the records or new ones.\n\nThere are three ways of representing the data – as charts, as table and the so called Parental View, which is intended for the parents of the child, or. for people that does not have in-depth medical knowledge.\n\nThe most complex of those views is the charts view because it provides unique set of features:\n\nIt can display multiple charts together, keeping them well ordered, no matter what the data is.\nIt has “time navigation” and even a zoom feature, allowing you to move in different portions of the data.\nIt can display three types of data together (the patient measurements plus up to two data sets). This allows you to compare the patient data with some statistical average.\nIt has an interactive selection, meaning that you can click somewhere on the canvas to select a point in time and see the details about the records near that time. You can also move the mouse over another point(s) and compare them with the current selection.",
